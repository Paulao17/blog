This year will go down in History books. The biggest crisis thus far into 2020 is the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) epidemic. First reports of clusters of cases of pneumonia were reported December 31<sup>st</sup> 2019 in Wuhan, China, and were quickly attributed to the novel coronavirus <sup>[1][1]</sup>. Different countries handled it very well and others didn't act accordingly and it shows. The term `pandemic` has a straightforward etymology : it originates from the greek "`pan`", all, and "`demos`", people. It impacts everyone but does not hit everybody equally hard.

The Chinese government took drastic measures to ensure the safety of its citizens, enforcing a lockdown on almost 60 million inhabitants<sup>[2][2]</sup> and building modular emergency response hospitals in record time. These efforts led to the 15 quarantined cities to being free of any active cases<sup>[3][3]</sup> and lifting their lockdown on April 8<sup>th</sup> after 76 days.
South Korea had a more acute but effective approach. By tracking cases and isolating every person they have had contact with, conducting over 600,000 tests<sup>[4][4]</sup> (population of about 52 million<sup>[5][5]</sup>), they limited their number of cases to under 11,000 and less than 250 deaths<sup>[4][4]</sup>. They utilized technology and quickly built apps to track the infected and publicize known places where they have been. This solution was successfully adopted in Taiwan, Vietnam and Singapore with similar results<sup>[6][6]</sup>.

The American government's response, or lack of, to the worldwide issue has been quite alarming. President Trump was informed in multiple intelligence briefings, starting in January, of the risk of a Pandemic that may become a threat to Americans yet he neglected these warnings<sup>[7][7],[8][8]</sup>.
>“Donald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were — they just couldn’t get him to do anything about it,” - U.S. Intelligence official<sup>[7][7]</sup>.

As companies attempt to anticipate and mitigate the economic consequences of the pandemic, millions are being laid off, with 5.7 million registering for unemployment in March alone<sup>[9][9]</sup>, later rising to an unprecedented 30 million by April 30<sup>th</sup><sup>[12][12]</sup>. In March, the rate was 4.0 percent for Whites, 6.7 percent for Blacks, 4.1 percent for Asians, and 6.0 percent for Hispanics<sup>[9][9],[10][10]</sup>. We notice a difference of up to 2.7% between groups. In the first quarter of 2020, the median weekly earnings of Blacks and Hispanics were 79% and 74% respectively of those of Whites<sup>[11][11]</sup>. In regular times, this is already a great disparity, but in a time of crisis this difference is felt even harder. Some ethnic groups are subject to harsher economical situations than others during the pandemic.
As established above, people from minorities have lost their jobs disproportionately to the overall job loss. In the U.S., health insurance is often tied to the employer so when one loses their job, they might also lose their health insurance. Additionally, Black Americans are more likely to have pre-existing conditions<sup>[13][13]</sup>.  This makes it so people of color are more endangered both financially and medically by the system.

Some minorities are often subject to prejudices.
>"I don’t feel safe wearing a handkerchief or something else that isn’t CLEARLY a protective mask covering my face to the store because I am a Black man living in this world.  I want to stay alive but I also want to stay alive." - [Aaron Thomas](https://twitter.com/Aaron_TheThomas/status/1246493711032356866)

Black men are perceived by some to be a threat. Hiding your face can be seen as menacing and they dwell on whether they should wear homemade masks or not when in public for their own safety.
Some Asian Americans, a number of which have never left the American mainland, have been falsely accused of bringing the virus to the Continental United States, falling victim to verbal and sometimes physical harassment. Thousands of incidents have been reported<sup>[14][14]</sup>.

As the virus spreads around America, other countries are already back to business as usual. Our workers are stuck at home, some without work or insurance, and the $1200 stimulus checks aren't going to last forever. Our minorities are hit harder and it is critical to keep everyone afloat amid this crisis. The government needs to enforce quickly better policies, science-based, to keep the people safe. We, the people, need to clear our minds of any prejudices and, unless we are essential workers, **stay home**.
